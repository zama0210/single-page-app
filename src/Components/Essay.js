        <p className="media-card__description">
          The Poietic Generator is a social network game designed by Olivier
          Auber in 1986 and developed from 1987. In the collaborative game,
          players collectively draw recognisable forms on a shared digital
          canvas in real time (Narrabase.net, 2015). A similar concept that has
          adopted the same principle is the 2017 r/place project (a
          collaborative effort that allowed Reddit users to put a pixel on a
          canvas every five minutes. Through an examination of the Poietic
          Generator, this essay will critically analyse how the internet serves
          as a transformative medium, redefining the traditional understanding
          of art by facilitating collaborative creation, democratizing access,
          and challenging established hierarchies. Net art, also known as
          Internet art, is a fascinating form of art that makes use of the
          Internet as its primary platform. It covers a wide range of works
          created by talented artists who utilize web browsers, coding, scripts,
          search engines, and other online tools to bring their visions to life.
          What sets net art apart is its interactive and participatory nature,
          which allows viewers to have unique and interconnected experiences
          (Netspecific.net, 2014). This genre of art breaks away from
          traditional forms and relies heavily on the Internet for its
          existence, highlighting elements like interactivity and connectivity.
          Its roots can be traced back to various artistic movements and
          traditions, including Dada, Fluxus, video art, and performance art,
          and it has evolved into a constantly evolving medium that adapts to
          the fast-paced advancements of technology and society (Artsy, 2016).
          In contrast to traditional games, the Poietic Generator operates
          uniquely. Instead of linear gameplay, it takes place in a
          two-dimensional matrix. Here, players have control over graphic
          elements, with one pixel assigned to each person. It may bring to mind
          Conway's Game of Life or the surrealist's Exquisite Corpse, but it
          sets itself apart by placing the power in the hands of the players,
          rather than relying on algorithms (ResearchGate, 2024). The objective
          of the game is not to win or lose, but to work together to create
          recognizable forms and observe the collaborative process. The name
          "Poietic Generator" is a nod to the idea of self-organization,
          inspired by the concept of autopoiesis in life sciences and poietic in
          the realm of art, highlighting the continuous emergence of the bigger
          picture. The game offers a unique opportunity for players to delve
          into a learning experience of social phenomena, where they can observe
          and interpret autopoietic processes, much like those found in living
          beings. It also introduces the concept of eigenfrequencies, similar to
          those found in other autopoietic systems, which leads to a dynamic
          interplay between structure and chaos (ResearchGate, 2024). The
          Poietic Generator is like a beautiful piece of art that exists within
          the digital world. It is unique and special in the way it operates,
          and it is considered net art because of that (Net-art.org, 2024). This
          is because it is not just a static piece, but rather a dynamic one
          that involves all players in a collaborative creation process. Each
          player contributes a small part to a larger mosaic, and together, they
          manipulate and shape the final result. The end product is an
          unpredictable and ever-changing narrative, full of autonomous forms
          that tell their own stories(ResearchGate, 2024). This process
          perfectly embodies the essence of net art, using the
          interconnectedness and interactivity of the internet to create a
          collective visual experience. The Poietic Generator truly highlights
          the principles of net art by engaging multiple players in the creation
          and observation of emergent patterns within a digital space. It is a
          prime example of the power of collaboration and the endless
          possibilities of the internet. The Poietic Generator has had a
          profound impact on the net art movement, serving as a trailblazing
          example of interactive and generative art. It has been recognized and
          praised by several esteemed art historians, theorists, and artists,
          including Don Foresta, Gilbertto Prado, and Mario Costa. Its
          significance in the world of digital art is widely acknowledged, as it
          was created before the advent of the internet in 1994 and was
          initially utilized on experimental Multicast networks, foreshadowing
          future technological advancements such as IPv6. The game's unique
          concept, in which human players can control graphic elements in
          real-time within a two-dimensional matrix, has sparked countless
          variations and derivative works since its inception in 1986 (The Art
          Story, 2016). The influence of the Poietic Generator extends far
          beyond the boundaries of art, inspiring professionals in fields such
          as architecture, planning, social science, anthropology, and even
          commercial games like Minecraft and r/place. By embodying the
          principles of self-organization, autopoiesis, and cognitive art, the
          Poietic Generator has left an enduring mark on the net art movement,
          revolutionizing the way artists interact with digital networks,
          embrace interactivity, and collaborate in the creative process (The
          Art Story, 2016). The Poietic Generator has had a profound impact on
          the development of other interactive art projects, setting a precedent
          for participatory digital art and collaborative online experiences. By
          creating a platform that allows for collective creation without
          centralized control, the Poietic Generator has sparked inspiration in
          artists, researchers, and developers alike, pushing them to explore
          new frontiers in the realm of interactive art (The Art Story, 2016).
          Its focus on cultural production, decentralized participation, and
          continuous adaptation has shaped the evolution of participatory
          methods in digital architecture and art, resulting in a diverse range
          of outcomes and possibilities for collaborative creativity (Grasser,
          n.d.). The conceptual features of the Poietic Generator, such as the
          ability for individual authors to claim multiple pixels, facilitate
          continuous adaptation of content, and promote an open and
          decentralized canvas, have played a pivotal role in the realization of
          collective forms, and provided valuable insights into questions of
          authorship and open-ended design (Grasser, n.d.). As one of the
          earliest examples of digital social experimentation, the Poietic
          Generator has been a driving force in advocating for a more inclusive,
          open, and collaborative approach to cultural production in the world
          of interactive art and beyond. Its impact has led to a shift in
          perspective, with artists and creators now embracing the concept of
          the "metagame‚Äù (Giaccardi, 2006). This unique viewpoint challenges us
          to question our social interactions, particularly those influenced by
          technology and social media. As a result, we are now delving deeper
          into the potential of technology and networks to redefine the cultural
          and anthropological significance of interactive art. One interesting
          idea that has been influenced by the Poietic Generator is the concept
          of conceptual tools for the new 'perspecteurs' from Abraham Bosse
          (Giaccardi, 2006). This means providing individuals with a set of
          tools to help them reimagine how technology can shape culture and
          practices, rather than simply being a tool (Giaccardi, 2006). This
          approach has had a significant impact on the development of
          alternative interactive art forms that challenge the traditional view
          of technology and its impact on cultural production. Though this game
          has garnered positive change towards the art movement, it has been met
          with criticism. The main criticisms of the Poietic Generator were the
          lack of clear objectives, the complexity and accessibility of the
          game, its repetitive nature, limited interactivity, and its influence
          on commercial games (Giaccardi, 2006). Critics have expressed concern
          over the Poietic Generator's design, noting its lack of defined
          objectives and goals for players to strive towards. This has raised
          the possibility of players feeling lost or uncertain about their
          purpose within the game. The open-ended nature of the game, with its
          focus on collective creation and observation of emergent patterns, may
          contribute to this sense of aimlessness. Without a clear definition of
          success or achievement, players may struggle to understand the
          significance of their contributions to the larger mosaic. This issue
          is especially relevant in the context of the Poietic Generator's role
          as a social network game. By encouraging collaboration and the
          blending of individual contributions, the game's design may
          inadvertently create a sense of confusion or lack of direction.
          Without a clear understanding of what constitutes success, players may
          feel unsure of their role and their impact on the overall game
          experience. This could lead to a feeling of aimlessness and
          frustration among participants. Moreover, the Poietic Generator's
          emphasis on collaborative creation and observation of emerging
          patterns may also cause some participants to feel lost or unsure
          (Dessalles, Saillenfest and Auber, n.d.). The game's emphasis on the
          ever-changing and unpredictable nature of the global mosaic,
          influenced by the collective decisions of all players, can create a
          sense of ambiguity or perplexity among participants. This ambiguity
          may stem from the fact that the game's outcome is not predetermined,
          but rather influenced by the collective actions of all players, which
          can be unpredictable and challenging to grasp. The Poietic Generator
          can be quite complex and may not be easily accessible to everyone
          (Dessalles, Saillenfest and Auber, n.d.). Its mechanics require a
          substantial number of players to participate simultaneously, which can
          pose challenges for those looking to join in. This could limit the
          game's appeal to a wider audience. Furthermore, the intricacy of the
          game's design, with its real-time collaboration among multiple
          players, may create barriers for those who are not familiar with its
          mechanics or prefer simpler gameplay experiences. On top of that,
          coordinating a large number of participants to engage at the same time
          can be a logistical nightmare, especially when considering variables
          such as time zones, availability, and the effort needed to keep the
          game going. One of the main challenges in keeping a game dynamic and
          engaging is ensuring that there is a large and diverse player base.
          This can be difficult to achieve, as it may be hard to attract and
          retain a wide range of players. Furthermore, accessibility can be an
          issue for those with limited time or specific needs that may make it
          difficult for them to fully participate. This can be a barrier for
          individuals who prefer to play alone or who may have limitations that
          prevent them from joining group activities in real time. Although the
          Poietic Generator offers an interactive experience, some critics have
          raised concerns that the level of interactivity may not be captivating
          or stimulating enough for certain individuals, resulting in a less
          immersive experience. This is seen from the limited individual agency.
          The design of the Poietic Generator has a limitation where each player
          can only contribute in a 20x20 pixel area (Poietic-generator.net,
          2014). This might make the personal interaction with the game seem
          less impactful or empowering for certain players, resulting in a less
          immersive experience. As players engage in the gameplay, they may
          notice a sense of repetition that arises. This is due to the
          continuous formation of recognizable patterns or images within the
          confined 20x20 pixel space. Over time, this repetitive nature can
          potentially result in a feeling of monotony. As a result, the novelty
          and excitement of the interactive experience may diminish,
          particularly for those who crave diversity, difficulty, or evolving
          elements in their involvement with digital art projects. Critics have
          expressed concerns about the Poietic Generator's impact on popular
          games such as Minecraft and r/place, suggesting that its original
          artistic purpose may have been diluted within the net art community
          (Giaccardi, 2006). The argument suggests that while the Poietic
          Generator is widely recognized as a significant contribution to
          digital, interactive, and generative art, its move to commercial
          gaming platforms may have shifted its focus from artistic exploration
          and collaborative creation to more profit-driven objectives. This
          alteration has the potential to compromise the initial ethos of the
          Poietic Generator, which was intended as a thought-provoking social
          experiment that prioritizes collective creativity and observation of
          emerging patterns, rather than competitive or commercial motives. The
          Poietic Generator, a groundbreaking social media game within the world
          of internet art, has made a significant impact on the landscape of
          digital art. By promoting a collaborative approach to creation, this
          platform has not only democratized access to art but has also
          challenged traditional hierarchies. However, despite its innovative
          nature and positive influence, the game has faced criticism for its
          lack of clear objectives, complex gameplay, and potential loss of its
          original artistic purpose on mainstream gaming platforms. In essence,
          the Poietic Generator serves as a testament to the immense power of
          collaboration and the transformative capabilities of the internet in
          redefining the very concept of art. Yet, it also sheds light on the
          difficulties of maintaining engagement, accessibility, and artistic
          integrity in interactive digital experiences. Reference List Artsy.
